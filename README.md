+ Project summary: In this project, we implement two algorithms on Author Disambiguation: (1) Naive Bayes method proposed by "Two Supervised Learning Approaches for Name Disambiguation in Citations" (Han,2004) and (2) Agglometative Clustering proposed by "Author Disambiguation Using Error Driven Machine Learning with a Ranking Loss Function". We further evaluate the prediction accuracy, algorithm sensitivity as well as implementation easiness of both methods respectively. Due to the limitation of computational capacity, we made some reasonable modification to the original algorithm suggested in paper 5 (Culotta 2007). Suggestions for further improvement are also provided.

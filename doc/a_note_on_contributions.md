+ Summary: In this project, we implement two algorithms on Author Disambiguation: (1) Naive Bayes method proposed by "Two Supervised Learning Approaches for Name Disambiguation in Citations" (Han,2004) and (2) Agglometative Clustering proposed by "Author Disambiguation Using Error Driven Machine Learning with a Ranking Loss Function". We further evaluate the predicting accuracy, algorithm sensitivity as well as implementation easiness of both method respectively. Due to a limitation of computational capacity, we made some reasonable modification to the original algorithm suggested in paper 5 (Culotta 2007). Suggestions for further improvement are also provided.
